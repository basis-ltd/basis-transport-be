## Overview

This is the backend service for Basis Transport, responsible for managing buses, routes, users, and real-time tracking. It is built with Node.js, TypeScript, and Express, and uses a modular architecture for scalability and maintainability.

---

## Architecture

- **Entry Point:** `src/server.ts` starts the HTTP server.
- **App Initialization:** `src/app.ts` sets up the Express app, middleware, and routes.
- **Database:** `src/data-source.ts` configures the database connection (likely using TypeORM or similar).
- **Modular Structure:** Business logic is separated into services, routes, middlewares, helpers, and entities.
- **Environment Variables:** Managed via a `.env` file for sensitive configuration.

## Folder Structure

```
src/
  app.ts            # Express app setup
  server.ts         # Application entry point
  data-source.ts    # Database connection/config
  constants/        # Application-wide constants
  entities/         # ORM entities/models
  helpers/          # Utility/helper functions
  middlewares/      # Express middlewares
  routes/           # Express route handlers
  services/         # Business logic/services
  types/            # TypeScript type definitions
```

**You should also create a `.env.example` file in your project root as described above.**

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+ recommended)
- npm (v8+ recommended)
- A running database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/basis-transport-be.git
   cd basis-transport-be
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables:**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the required values.
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. **Run database migrations (if applicable):**
   ```bash
   # Example for TypeORM
   npm run typeorm migration:run
   ```

---

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory. Here's an example of what it might look like:

```env
# .env.example

# Server
PORT=3000

# Database
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USERNAME=your_db_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
DB_NAME=basis_transport

# JWT
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret

# Other
NODE_ENV=development
```

**Note:** Do not commit your real `.env` file to version control.

---

## Running the Application

### Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the server with hot-reloading (using `ts-node-dev` or similar).

### Production

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

- `npm run build` compiles TypeScript to JavaScript in the `dist/` folder.
- `npm start` runs the compiled code.

---

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` — Start in development mode
- `npm run build` — Compile TypeScript
- `npm start` — Start in production mode
- `npm test` — Run tests (if configured)
- `npm run lint` — Lint the codebase
